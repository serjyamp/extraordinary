							h2.h2 All sail being set, he now cast loose the life-line, reserved.
						p.box__bottom-summary Soon all the boats but Starbuck's were dropped; all the boat-sails set all the paddles plying; with rippling swiftness, shooting to leeward; and Ahab heading the onset. A pale, death-glimmer lit up Fedallah's sunken eyes; a hideous motion.

							h2.h2 Robin Thicke: Longest Hot 100 Reign This Year
						p.box__bottom-summary The line originally used in the fishery was of the best hemp, slightly vapoured with tar, not impregnated with it, as in the case of ordinary ropes; for while tar, as ordinarily used, makes the hemp more pliable to the rope-maker, Of late years the Manilla rope has in the American fishery almost entirely superseded hemp as.

							h2.h2 A-Rod, A Fraud, And A Waste Of Yankees Money, Public's Time
						p.box__bottom-summary Enough already.  I can’t take it no more.  Free us from enslavement to all this banter. OK, so my fit of anger this morning is not steroid- induced…though that would be fitting in light of recent discussions. Baseball talk of late has centered upon performance enhancing drugs.  Biogenesis has become the new BALCO.  A-Rod the new Barry Bonds. And all I hear from various media types are questions like.

							h2.h2 A Strange Brand of Happy
						p.box__bottom-summary An aimless bachelor loses his job and finds himself chasing the same girl (his new life coach) that his manipulative ex-boss is after as well. The boys are spurred on by a rag tag group of retirees in need of some action.

							h2.h2 The whale-line is only two-thirds of an inch in thickness
						p.box__bottom-summary At first sight, you would not think it so strong as it really is. By experiment its one and fifty yarns will each suspend a weight of one hundred and twenty pounds; so that the whole rope will bear a strain nearly equal to three tons.
